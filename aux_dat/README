    Near-IR.

    Air mass of unity, water vapor column of 1mm.

    Attenuated flux = input flux * 10 ** (- Extinction(lambda) * AIRMASS / 2.5)

    Optical is already extinction, eqn. (5) of https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2013/01/aa19834-12.pdf
    K \equiv e(lambda) * X  where X is the airmass.  See Specsim read the docs. 

  
    Necessary to convert near-ir from Transmission to extinction.  
    Downsampled to 2A to match MKO optical.

    Is this sufficient?    
    Should extinction be applied to the sky emission?

7.  PFS basic instrument:
        Mirror eff. area: 8.2m
    	As effective, set support_width and obscuration to 0.0;  
    	Is this really true of obscuration?

    field_radius:  How to treat hexagon to cicular comparison?  Stick with greatest distance across or equate
                   area?

    plate scale:   According to the plate scale without microlens, 100um subtends 1.1 arcsec on the sky; i.e. 90.9 um/'' platescale.
    	  	   Assuming a 1.102 increase to field radius, this is 100.17 um/'' at the radius. 
    	           (1) below Table on https://pfs.ipmu.jp/research/parameters.html

		   With microlens, 113um = 1 arcsec at field centre; 124.51um = 1 arcsec at field radius.
		   Corresponds to 10.2% increase (with microlens).
		   
  		   For DESI, the increase is 4% percent. 

		   --  I've renormalised the curve to have central MPS of 90.9 
                       and rescaled wavelength to give 10% difference across field (radius).
		       Radial and azimuthal directions treated similarly. 
 
    fiber loss     Linear extrapolation in wavelength. 
    
    blur values:   Stick with DESI files?  No need for wavelength extension?  Assumed zero? 
    offset values: Stick with DESI files?  No need for wavelength extension?  Assumed zero?
